# _*ASCII-ART-REVERSE*_

- A simple Go program to reverse the ASCII graphic representation into text.

## _*Description*_

Ascii-reverse consists on reversing the process, converting the graphic representation into a text. The program takes a flag as an argument, `--reverse=<fileName>`, where `--reverse` is the flag and `<fileName>` is the file name. The program then prints the ASCII art in normal text.
