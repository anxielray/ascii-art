STARTING WITH ASCII-ART-REVERSE.

Understanding The Question.

- It's all about reversing the process other than the letters.

Requirements
- Create a textual file with a graphic representation of a 
string given as an argument. The argument will be 
`--reverse=<fileName>`The program should then pront it out as a plain 
text. 

- The flag passing must be in the very exact format as mentioned. 
Else, the error message to be given is:

`Usage:  go run . [OPTION]

 Ex: go run . --reverse=<fileName>

- Other ascii art projects implemented should be incooperated...
